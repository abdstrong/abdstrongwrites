<h2>Peer influence</h2>
<p>The existence of peer influence has been rocking the world for quite ages, even before my grandfather were born.
Peer influence play a great role in the life of everyone,most of the times. Anyone you are or become, its keen on those you chose as your friends,the changes,the intimidation or any act they bring about your life is what was influenced by your peer.
In the olden ages peer influence isn't what it has become now, then it entails friends encouraging one another to do good things,and be useful for the society, it involves love,that creates bond that make twos stand for each other like families,though there were bad peers but even them,were always ashamed of displaying their identity.
What do we have now ?. Peers that teaches to smoke,peers that teaches other to do a lot of things that are unacceptable or even against a good society, we now have less number of bad peers. Peers nowadays are keen on making money only,even when it warrant shredding bloods of fellow humans.
Wish we could really have a reset button then we could go back to the good form of life we had then.
What an atrocity change to the peer world.

<h3>Forgoten Diamond's sacrifice</h3>
<p>We all keep talking, about our mother,about how much love they deserve ,how much they cared for us we talk about the good things they have done,including the amazing sacrifices they made for us.
We always seem to always forget an important personality,which is the father,while the mother let the baby sleep in her arms,the father is most times the chair the mother is sitting on but the baby only get to notice the mother's care  while the father's huge sacrifice ignored.
The mother takes care of the children and home but the father make sure the mother and children are doing good.
We keep sounding the mothers struggle in the labour room, don't you forget even the father's heart is in labour,when things go well his heart delivers an unexplainable happiness,when things go other way his heart delivers an unending  sorrow and pain, while the mother is in the labour room the husband runs helter and skelter to make things stable for you,to bring all necessity to place, why can we forget these great sacrifices.
Most of the times woman gives advice not to hurt the child's feelings mean while some of it might hurt his future,but the father thinks to  straight for  future purposes even when the child would be unhappy, a father guides mother when taking care of a child so as not to lead him astray for the present and future interests.
The father is the one who carries the whole burden like it his.
In conclusion this article is not to condemn celebrating the mothers they really worth it ,
But never forget the diamond sacrifice.

<h3>New world,New moment</h3>
<p>What an Extremist level of malevolence  we now engage in. All the efforts of our past mediocre,warlords, great grandfathers and mothers for us to lead a better life all in devastation.
Goodness and true love  walked away from the world disgracefully, only few goodness and love struggle to stay behind for those who need them. we invented our own evil covered with a smoke of deceit.
The efforts of our great technologists and extraordinary scientist all turned inside a black dirty deep canal.
Days where accident scenes are filled within seconds by people ready to give their love saving the accident victims,Days all phones and communication means are busy trying to save the injured accident victims. That was long ago we now see those days only in books and dreams.
All we care about now is to take document of presence at the scene,Robbing the victims of their money and sometimes lives.
Civilisation along side the invention of technology was aimed for the good purpose,Now its aim has been diverted to be a war against our kind strong hearts,a war against our unending love,Turned war against our peaceful humanity.

<h2>life sacrasm</h2>
<p>Life with the rhyme .<br/>

You beat me , you teach me .<br/>

You see me , you snub me .<br/>

You need me , you call me .<br/>

I need you , you ditch me .<br/>

You use me , you dump .<br/>

I feel bad , then learn my lesson .<br/>

</p>

<h2>pictured memories</h2>
<p>Do you recall this day he said,<br/>
I had to think deeply at first,<br/>
It was me holding a hen,<br/>
I posed painting her body red.<br/>

Do you recall this day he said,<br/>
My mood really changed at first,<br/>
This is a bad memory i said,<br/>
That was when my girl lost her leg.<br/>

Do you recall this day he said,<br/>
I smiled showing my dimple at first,<br/>
It was after we shot our enemies dead,<br/>
And painted their hood red.<br/>

</p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-10 poem text-center">
<h2>Lifestyle</h2>
<p>Bird flies,<br/>
 so does the time.<br/>

Leaders write,<br/>
 to make things right.<br/>

We keep hoping,<br/>
Even when we are left broken.<br/>

Memories are always with us,<br/>
Even those we were at loss.<br/>

We don't give chances for stops,<br/>
We don't go without settling scores.<br/>

Dreams get shattered,<br/>
My hairs without a comb,scattered.<br/>

We resist evil coming,<br/>
We get to pray more often.<br/>
</p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-10 poem text-center">
<h2>HOPE</h2>
<p>
walked in darkness,<br/>
With devil offering me water.<br/>

Walked in the rain,<br/>
When shelter was far away.<br/>

Walked in the sun,<br/>
Only my shadow stayed.<br/>

The burning of the sun,<br/>
The lashes from the rain,<br/>
Forever visit of hunger.<br/>

Ran till running became impossible,<br/>
Worked till working glued to my soul.<br/>

Even with not a chance of snowball in hell,<br/>
I never let my hope sleep in hunger.<br/>
</p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-10 poem text-center">
<h2>crazy demo</h2>
<p>
Atrophy of the anger from hunger,<br/>
killing my happiness slowly, just like murder.<br/>
my resistance to this attack began to rundown.<br/>
i should have moved somewhere else not OYO town.<br/>

Degeneracy of good morals,<br/>
leaving all daily routine out of order,<br/>
good deed becoming skinny,looks like fish sun dried.<br/>
meeting to make wrongs die,giving chances for rights.<br/>

Supremacy of the  corrupt niggas,<br/>
They are niggas not worthy to be called leaders,<br/>
Safety and the good of the country,Never intact.<br/>
curses rained on them always like being in the  shower.<br/>

Slavery of the human rights,<br/>
denied lot of things,even right to fight.<br/>
we were ruled under fright,<br/>
ruining all our good efforts in no time.<br/>

one day we would be free,<br/>
The dreamt ease and happiness would become real,<br/>
A little bit change is what we would need,<br/>
This changes should start from you and me.<br/>

</p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-10 poem text-center">
<h2>darkest hour</h2>
<p>
My darkest hour,<br/>
Is my weakest hour.<br/>

Roses turned to black,<br/>
Light left me without looking back.<br/>

Hours along the road side,<br/>
Couldn't see, even when my future is bright.<br/>

It was all night,<br/>
I heard noises and was filled with fright.<br/>

Never knew which route was mine,<br/>
Couldn't figure which hole was for my rat.<br/>
right to light,is what i lack.<br/>

</p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-10 poem text-center">
<h2>REFRAIN</h2>
<p>
Like a bomb landed the pain,<br/>
Like the breeze the sweetness sway,<br/>
Intense knockout poverty gave.<br/>

My days never continue the same,<br/>
I work when the sky laughed and cried.<br/>

The detainment of extreme sadness.<br/>

The integrating of my daily routine,<br/>
Depreciation of my daily happiness.<br/>

This, I never wished for,<br/>
Uninvited it came.<br/>

Even while taunting keeps kissing me,<br/>
Sadness glued to my skin.<br/>

The pain aggravating,<br/>
Stopping was never a friend.<br/>

Even when suffering keeps winning ease,<br/>
I still keep trying, with struggles grinning.<br/>

</p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-10 poem text-center">
<h2>Darkness</h2>
<p>
O ye darkness,<br/>
Go get yourself a touch light <br/>
Oh! impossible ?<br/>


O ye rich shorties,<br/>
Buy yourself height .<br/>
Oh! impossible ?<br/>


O ye girlies, <br/>
Want to become a boy.<br/>
Oh! Impossible ?<br/>

Many wishes, <br/>
Little possibilities<br/>

</p>

<h2>COVID-19</h2>
<p>
Rising from China ,given birth to in Wuhan .
Burning our peace like fire , hitting the world like thunder.<br/>

Ranging from severe cold ,
Increasing to some disease ,known and unknown.<br/>

Bringing us nose covers as part of our face ,leaving our hands with gloves ,
Getting us quarantined for safety.<br/>

Airports closed ,roads blocked ,movements restrictions,
 markets inactive ,schools locked down ,bringing  office activities to a brink.<br/>

Putting the world in panic ,fumigating every locations,
Everything seems like the world is going to end soon.<br/>


</p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-10 poem text-center">
<h2>Diasease outbreak</h2>
<p>
What a dangerous happening, people are scared. <br/>
A kind of happening, that turns rich to poor. <br/>
A kind of happening,that turns, brave to coward. <br/>
A very bad happening,that turns strong to helpless . <br/>

People feel unsafe ,people are dying . <br/>
Couples  cautious of getting close . <br/>
Parents cautious of, close relations with children. <br/>
Friends abstaining from friends ,people losing their sweet moments . <br/>
This happening comes with headache ,sometimes fever . <br/>
Comes With different kinds of illness as  symptoms . <br/>
This happening damages human health . <br/>
Land lords becoming homeless ,Employee becoming jobless. <br/>
People roam less on the street ,
Happiness became scarce ,fear became and addiction .<br/>

Hospitals getting overcrowded ,health workers working tirelessly. <br/>
Population decreasing ,death rate increasing . <br/>
All the countries shaken, every living thing on earth became restless . <br/>
We all started getting overprotective ,we became defensive to the happening . <br/>
Later on we defeated it , a cure was found . <br/>
Everyone rejoiced ,happiness visited again . <br/>

<div class="col-md-10 poem text-center">
<h2>JINGLE BELL</h2>
<p>
Jingle bell, jingle bell<br/>
Always disturbing the peace in my ear, <br/>
I cant help but still Hume to the noise. <br/>

Waves traveling though medium, <br/>
Sticking to my ear drum like it had been gummed. <br/>

Noise like when gun is being fired, <br/>
We keep running ,even when we start feeling tired . <br/>

Noise like my mum waking me from sleep , <br/>
I get up and say my morning supplications . <br/>

Moving to the kitchen to do the cleaning , <br/>
Noise from the plates in the sink,noise from the tap pouring out water ,the spoons being arranged in order . <br/>

Walked to the bathroom to freshen up , <br/>
Noise from the mouth brushing ,sounds from the shower . <br/>

Cries of my sisters ,anger of my stomach worms ,different formation of wave . <br/>

</p>
</div>


<div class="col-md-10 poem text-center">
<h2>EXTRAORDINARY</h2>
<p>
The right definition for the canary 
Her voice is so uncanny . <br/>
She was invited for the bicentenary . <br/>

The party was  awesome . <br/>
Even elders who were of the antebellum attended . <br/>
The duration of the party wasn't extended . <br/>
So back to our home we descended . <br/>


</p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-10 poem text-center">
<h2>HATRED</h2>
<p>
When I pick up a pen ,I don't pick it right .
When I cook ,too much complaint .
When I do good they still lament .<br/>

Running Errands day and night . <br/>
Yet lament of me not doing it right . <br/>
They remind me of my family ,they never loved to see me happy . <br/>

I feel like a living dead ,I seem like a walking corpse . <br/>
What did I do to deserve this ,why the act of jealousy . <br/>
Why do you show me so Much pain ,so Much than I could bare . <br/>
I sleep in pain ,wake up to the same . <br/>

The world seem upside down ,love is nothing close to me ,thoughts of suicide everyday . <br/>
Well I keep trying so hard ,knowing one day my life will be so bright . <br/>
You bate me because am gonna be better . <br/>
You hate Me because my success is like that of ocean. <br/>
One day I will be Free from hatred . <br/>

<div class="col-md-10 poem text-center">
<h2>RAMADAN</h2>
<p>
Ramadan month of blessing , <br/>
Lot of good deeds without resting, <br/>
Saying my adhkar without stopping . <br/>

Abstaining from food, <br/>
Abstaining from haram looks. <br/>

Abstaining from drinks, <br/>
Abstaining from lot of sleep. <br/>

All my morning and nights for Allah, <br/>
He is the merciful and the forgiver. <br/>

Lot of prayers and recitation, <br/>
Calling to good without hesitation. <br/>

Month of blessing, <br/>
Month of mercy, <br/>
Month of sorrow washing, <br/>
Month of glory. <br/>

Ya Allah let me be alive, <br/>
To partake in good deeds and fasting, <br/>
In the month of blessing. <br/>
